                                <p>
                                    This trial is shaping up to be a close one. Media Specialist Nico Bruinsma reported, after interviewing several of the witnesses, that there is nearly an even split between the decision before the trial. However, after watching the jurors illegally before the trial, there may be evidence of a mistrial! It seems like all three jurors have already made up their minds, does this mean they need to be renewed? My personal belief is that this trial is going to completely go off the rails. From my time hanging around the groups it seems like both sides are hardly interviewing their witnesses and the witnesses are mostly confused on what is happening.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All I can say is that this trial is going to be enjoyable, but who will win? That is unpredictable, especially since the jurors have prejudice to the Industrial Revolution as I heard one talking about how they are always on the blog site named Reddit, so maybe they will always vote for the revolution, who knows!
                                </p>
                                <h2>The Arguments</h2>
                                <p>
                                    So what is happening with each side's arguments? Well, the prosecution is going to try a shockingly new idea to get the Industrial Revolution into prison, talking about climate change and health issues. These stupid lawyers (not you Aurian) will talk about how children worked a long time and were never able to have a real childhood and that the pollution around them caused mass pestilence, they were also underpaid all the time which caused a large amount of economic collapse, overall I can really see how bad the industrial revolution is. But we have to go and see the other side.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The defense is taking a unique perspective of entertainment, the Industrial Revolution helped people not be bored. People relied on new machines to have fun and enjoy themselves, the defense, by ignoring climate change and other issues the defense will win the trial. I am pretty confident in them, but it is interesting to see how they might fumble this!
                                </p>
                                <h2>What do the people think?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The defense clearly has no idea what they are doing, they seem completely disorganized and distraught at this trial. I began asking them questions and they started to respond nonsensically, I asked how the progress was going, and the lead lawyer, Dazia, just responded “I just got my frst questions done”, truly showing how the case that is so easy for them may be lost due to incompetence. After I began turning to the next lawyer, Jeremi Pastor, I heard Dazia also mutter to herself the worse “God is good, God is great, love America, insert eagle noises”, so I think they may be trying to get their insanity plea on the wrong person. After I began interviewing Jeremi he spoke confidently about how they are going to be winning because of the how beneficial the revolution was for the world, it was very interesting with him saying that he “will provide evidence” - Jeremi. It is a good start for them but also as I left I heard Jeremi Pastor also say that “there was a fat guy chasing us” which confused me and left me wondering if the defense will even hold up a single claim. I asked a few of the witnesses but they were too confused and all I really got was Henry Ford saying “Exqusite” a few times.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, the prosecution must be doing something better, especially since they left me leaving the interview with hope that they will create a reasonable argument, I asked them how their case was going and they said that they were excited and ready to beat the other side, except Tommy left me feeling uneasy saying “We are being chased”. This made me begin questioning the validity of the lawyers intelligence, so I asked them what five plus six was, and this was his response “10, wait no, eleven! Eleven! It’s eleven Mr. Bruinsma”, I won’t name this person as I dont want them to be harassed. It seems like both lawyers have their work cut out for them in the shape of a much bigger person, it will be a very neck and neck fight between these lawyers.
