                                <p>
                                    The verdict has come in! News news! This trial went down to the wire! Votes were being counted, first, guilty, second, not guilty! Then finally, the tie breaker, it all came down to the final vote.... it was..... NOT GUILTY!!! The defense won!! The Industrial Revolution has been declared a GOOD for society! Oh frabjous day!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Were people expecting this? Yeah! Probably, especially during the trial it was pretty obvious that the defense was going to win. The prosecution lazed around their desks picking their noses and whispering dark secrets into each others ears. The defense however was stone cold focused on saving our defendant, Brendan Lamb, a.k.a the Industrial Revolution.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Did we really expect it though?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    No! Not really, I know I just said that people were expecting this but also it could go either way. The jurors, although spilling the beans early on, must have gone back on their ideas and changed their vote, maybe they realized it is easier for them to write about the good rather than the bad. Well anyway, the verdict is in and the whole world is in an uproar. You can barely go through the streets without people asking you if you agreed!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I honestly don't know if anyone is really reading this at this point, if you are! Tell me! It's about eleven o'clock for me and I am just writing down what comes to mind now! Oops, thats a booger. Well anyway back to the story. Overall the defense really seemed like they less of an idea of what was going on, however, their work on training the witnesses really paid off as they were very cool under pressure. Karl Marx responded miracously to the prosecutions tough questions, and thoughtfully to the defenses prepared questions.
                                </p>
                                <h2>What do the people think?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    As I said earlier, the whole world is in an uproar, people from all sides of the world, I'm pretty sure I met a New Zealander, wherever that is, are all gathering around to meet and discuss the events of the world changing, life changing event! People are discussing if the jurors were bribed to give the vote, I think I did see Brendan Lamb, who is of course our defendant, slip a twenty to the jurors earlier. However, that is neither here nor there. Well anyway folks, I got one more paragraph in me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's right! There is more to talk about. I would like to talk about how the class didn't really vote or have a true consensus on this subject, I asked around and it was pretty even split on the actual decision. This is a bit more serious now, wow. Well, I honestly had no clue where it was going to go and it was pretty intense as the last vote was called right before a big quiz (which I failed, probably). Overall, my closing remarks on this trial is that it was really fun! I hope that soon enough I will be able to do another one, NOT AS MEDIA SPECIALIST THOUGH!!
